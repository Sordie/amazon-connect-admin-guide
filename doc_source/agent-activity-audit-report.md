# Agent activity audit report<a name="agent-activity-audit-report"></a>

The agent activity audit is like a report version of the [agent event stream](agent-event-streams.md)\. All of the data in this report is also in the agent event stream\.

For example, if there's something in the audit report you want to recreate, or if you want to recreate a different time period, you can do so using the agent event stream\.
