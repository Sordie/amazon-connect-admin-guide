| This is prerelease documentation for a service in preview release\. It is subject to change\. | 

Amazon Connect agent workspace is a single, intuitive application that provides your agents with the tools and step\-by\-step guidance needed to onboard quickly, resolve issues efficiently, and improve customer experiences\. Currently contact center agents might be required to use multiple applications to handle each customer interaction by digging through various tools to handle simple requests, which can lead to increased customer frustration while they are on hold\. Out\-of\-the\-box, agent workspace integrates all of your agent tools on one screen\. When an agent accepts a call, chat, or task, they’re given necessary information about the case and customer, plus real\-time recommendations\. Furthermore, the agent is presented with one\-step actions to resolve the customer’s issue more efficiently\. For more information on providing access to the agent workspace for your agents, see the [Agent training guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/agent-user-guide.html)\.
