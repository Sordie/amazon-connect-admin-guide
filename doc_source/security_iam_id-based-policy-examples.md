# Amazon Connect identity\-based policy examples<a name="security_iam_id-based-policy-examples"></a>

By default, IAM entities don't have permission to create or modify Amazon Connect resources\. They also can't perform tasks using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS API\. An IAM administrator must create IAM policies that grant IAM entities permission to perform specific API operations on the specified resources they need\. The IAM administrator must then attach those policies to the IAM entities that require those permissions\.

To learn how to create an IAM identity\-based policy using these example JSON policy documents, see [Creating Policies on the JSON Tab](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html#access_policies_create-json-editor) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

## Policy best practices<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-policy-best-practices"></a>

Identity\-based policies determine whether someone can create, access, or delete Amazon Connect resources in your account\. These actions can incur costs for your AWS account\. When you create or edit identity\-based policies, follow these guidelines and recommendations:
+ **Get started with AWS managed policies and move toward least\-privilege permissions** – To get started granting permissions to your users and workloads, use the *AWS managed policies* that grant permissions for many common use cases\. They are available in your AWS account\. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining AWS customer managed policies that are specific to your use cases\. For more information, see [AWS managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) or [AWS managed policies for job functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
+ **Apply least\-privilege permissions** – When you set permissions with IAM policies, grant only the permissions required to perform a task\. You do this by defining the actions that can be taken on specific resources under specific conditions, also known as *least\-privilege permissions*\. For more information about using IAM to apply permissions, see [ Policies and permissions in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
+ **Use conditions in IAM policies to further restrict access** – You can add a condition to your policies to limit access to actions and resources\. For example, you can write a policy condition to specify that all requests must be sent using SSL\. You can also use conditions to grant access to service actions if they are used through a specific AWS service, such as AWS CloudFormation\. For more information, see [ IAM JSON policy elements: Condition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
+ **Use IAM Access Analyzer to validate your IAM policies to ensure secure and functional permissions** – IAM Access Analyzer validates new and existing policies so that the policies adhere to the IAM policy language \(JSON\) and IAM best practices\. IAM Access Analyzer provides more than 100 policy checks and actionable recommendations to help you author secure and functional policies\. For more information, see [IAM Access Analyzer policy validation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-policy-validation.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.
+ **Require multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\)** – If you have a scenario that requires IAM users or a root user in your AWS account, turn on MFA for additional security\. To require MFA when API operations are called, add MFA conditions to your policies\. For more information, see [ Configuring MFA\-protected API access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_configure-api-require.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

For more information about best practices in IAM, see [Security best practices in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

## Allow IAM users to view their own permissions<a name="security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-view-own-permissions"></a>

This example shows how you might create a policy that allows IAM users to view the inline and managed policies that are attached to their user identity\. This policy includes permissions to complete this action on the console or programmatically using the AWS CLI or AWS API\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "ViewOwnUserInfo",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:GetUserPolicy",
                "iam:ListGroupsForUser",
                "iam:ListAttachedUserPolicies",
                "iam:ListUserPolicies",
                "iam:GetUser"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:iam::*:user/${aws:username}"]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "NavigateInConsole",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:GetGroupPolicy",
                "iam:GetPolicyVersion",
                "iam:GetPolicy",
                "iam:ListAttachedGroupPolicies",
                "iam:ListGroupPolicies",
                "iam:ListPolicyVersions",
                "iam:ListPolicies",
                "iam:ListUsers"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Grant "View User" permissions<a name="security_iam_id-based-policy-example-view-user-permissions"></a>

When you create a user or [group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id.html#id_iam-groups) in your AWS account, you can associate an IAM policy with that group or user, which specifies the permissions that you want to grant\.

For example, imagine you have a group of entry\-level developers\. You can create an IAM group named `Junior application developers`, and include all entry\-level developers\. Then, associate a policy with that group that grants them permissions to view Amazon Connect users\. In this scenario, you might have a policy such as the following sample\. 

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "connect:DescribeUser",
                "connect:ListUsers"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

This sample policy grants permissions to API actions listed in the `Action` element\.

**Note**  
If you don't specify a user ARN or ID in your statement, you must also grant the permission to use all resources for the action using the \* wildcard for the `Resource` element\.

## Allow users to integrate with external applications<a name="security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-integrate"></a>

This example shows how you might create a policy that allows users to interact with their external application integrations\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowAllAppIntegrationsActions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "app-integrations:ListEventIntegrations",
                "app-integrations:CreateEventIntegration",
                "app-integrations:GetEventIntegration",
                "app-integrations:UpdateEventIntegration",
                "app-integartions:DeleteEventIntegration",
                "app-integrations:ListDataIntegrations",
                "app-integrations:CreateDataIntegration",
                "app-integrations:GetDataIntegration",
                "app-integrations:UpdateDataIntegration",
                "app-integartions:DeleteDataIntegration"
            ],
            "Resource": "*" 
	}
	]
}
```

## Describe and update Amazon Connect users based on tags<a name="security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-view-widget-tags"></a>

In an IAM policy, you can optionally specify conditions that control when a policy is in effect\. For example, you can define a policy that allows users to update only an Amazon Connect user who is working in the test environment\.

You can define some conditions that are specific to Amazon Connect, and define other conditions that apply to all of AWS\. For more information and a list of AWS\-wide conditions, see Condition in [IAM JSON Policy Elements Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html#Condition) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 

The following sample policy allows the "describe" and "update" actions for users with specific tags\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "connect:DescribeUser",
                "connect:UpdateUser*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:ResourceTag/Department": "Test"
                }
            }            
        }
    ]
}
```

This policy allows "describe user" and "update user" but only for those Amazon Connect users tagged with tag "Department: Test" where "Department" is the tag key and "Test" is the tag value\. 

## Create Amazon Connect users based on tags<a name="connect-access-control-resources-example1"></a>

The following sample policy allows the create actions for users with specific request tags\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "connect:CreateUser",
                "connect:TagResource"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:RequestTag/Owner": "TeamA"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

This policy allows "create user" and "tag resource" but the tag "Owner: TeamA" must be present in the requests\.

## Create and view Amazon AppIntegrations resources<a name="appintegration-resources-example1"></a>

The following sample policy allows event integrations to be created, listed, and fetched\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "app-integrations:CreateEventIntegration",
                "app-integrations:GetEventIntegration",
                "app-integrations::ListEventIntegrations",
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Create and view Amazon Connect Wisdom Assistants<a name="wisdom-resources-example1"></a>

The following sample policy allows Wisdom assistants to be created, listed, fetched, and deleted\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "wisdom:CreateAssistant",
                "wisdom:GetAssistant",
                "wisdom:ListAssistants",
                "wisdom:DeleteAssistant",
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Manage outbound campaigns resources<a name="outboundcommunications-policy-example1"></a>

Onboarding permissions: The following sample policy allows Amazon Connect instances to be onboarded to outbound campaigns\.

```
"Sid": "VisualEditor0",
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Action": [
                 "kms:DescribeKey",
                 "kms:CreateGrant"
             ],
             "Resource": [
                 "arn:aws:kms:region:account-id:key/key-id"
                   ]
        },
        {
             "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Action": [
                 "connect:DescribeInstance"
             ],
             "Resource": [
          
                 "arn:aws:connect:region:account-id:instance/instance-id"
             ]
        },
        {
             "Sid": "VisualEditor2",
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Action": [
                 "events:PutTargets",
                 "events:PutRule",
                 "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole",
                 "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                 "iam:PutRolePolicy",
                 "ds:DescribeDirectories",
                 "connect-campaigns:StartInstanceOnboardingJob",
                 "connect-campaigns:GetConnectInstanceConfig",
                 "connect-campaigns:GetInstanceOnboardingJobStatus",
                 "connect-campaigns:DeleteInstanceOnboardingJob",
                 "connect:DescribeInstanceAttribute",
                 "connect:UpdateInstanceAttribute",
                 "connect:ListInstances",
                 "kms:ListAliases"
             ],
             "Resource": "*"
        }
```

To disable outbound campaigns for an instance, add the following permissions:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:DescribeKey",
                "kms:RetireGrant"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                 "arn:aws:kms:region:account-id:key/key-id"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "events:DeleteRule",
                "events:RemoveTargets",
                "events:DescribeRule",
                "iam:DeleteRolePolicy",
                "events:ListTargetsByRule",
                "iam:DeleteServiceLinkedRole",
                "connect-campaigns:DeleteConnectInstanceConfig"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
```

Management permissions: The following sample policy allows all read and write operations on outbound campaigns\.

```
{
    "Sid": "AllowConnectCampaignsOperations",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "connect-campaigns:CreateCampaign",
        "connect-campaigns:DeleteCampaign",
        "connect-campaigns:DescribeCampaign",
        "connect-campaigns:UpdateCampaignName",
        "connect-campaigns:GetCampaignState"
        "connect-campaigns:UpdateOutboundCallConfig",
        "connect-campaigns:UpdateDialerConfig",
        "connect-campaigns:PauseCampaign",
        "connect-campaigns:ResumeCampaign",
        "connect-campaigns:StopCampaign",
        "connect-campaigns:GetCampaignStateBatch",
        "connect-campaigns:ListCampaigns"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
}
```

ReadOnly permissions: The following sample policy allows read\-only access to the campaigns\.

```
{
    "Sid": "AllowConnectCampaignsReadOnlyOperations",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "connect-campaigns:DescribeCampaign",
        "connect-campaigns:GetCampaignState",
        "connect-campaigns:GetCampaignStateBatch",
        "connect-campaigns:ListCampaigns"
     ],
    "Resource": "*",
}
```

Tag\-based permissions: The following sample policy restricts access to the campaigns integrated with a particular Amazon Connect instance using tags\. More permissions can be added based on the use case\.

```
{
    "Sid": "AllowConnectCampaignsOperations",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "connect-campaigns:DescribeCampaign",
        "connect-campaigns:GetCampaignState"
    ],
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
             "aws:ResourceTag/owner": "arn:aws:connect:region:customer_account_id:instance/connect_instance_id"
         }
    }
}
```

**Note**  
`connect-campaigns:ListCampaigns` and `connect-campaigns:GetCampaignStateBatch` operations cannot be restricted by Tag\.
