To view agent activity audit reports, you need to be assigned to a security profile that either has Access checked for **Access metrics** or **Agent activity audit**\. When **Access metrics** is selected, the **Real\-time metrics, Historical metrics**, and **Agent activity audit** are automatically checked\.

If you have **Access metrics** checked, you have access to all real\-time and historical reports\. If you only have **Agent activity audit** checked, you only have access to the agent activity audit report and no other analytics pages or reports\.
