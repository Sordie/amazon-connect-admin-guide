# Overtime management<a name="scheduling-overtime"></a>

Simultaneously achieving Service Level \(SL\), Average Speed of Answer \(ASA\), and cost targets requires matching supply \(\# of agents\) and demand \(\# of contacts \* handle time\)\. Overtime \(OT\) and Voluntary Time Off \(VTO\) are two mechanisms that the contact center management team can deploy to achieve both targets\. OT allows handling a contact surge or agent shortages without the need to hire more employees while VTO allows handling a low volume contact period without the expenses of employees in an idle state\.
