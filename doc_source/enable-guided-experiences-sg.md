| This is prerelease documentation for a service in preview release\. It is subject to change\. | 

To request access to the Step\-by\-step guided experience preview, please reach out to AWS Support or your AWS point of contact in order to be added to the allow\-list for this feature\. Once youâ€™ve been added to the allow\-list, use the following steps to grant your users access to guides and the guide creation process\.

1. **Enable admins to create guides**

   In the security profiles section of the admin website, you give managers and business analysts access to the **Views** permission in order to grant them the ability to configure step\-by\-step guides in Flows\. Since guides are created using Flows, it is also necessary that this user has access to **Contact flows** edit and create permissions so that they can create any type of flow\.
