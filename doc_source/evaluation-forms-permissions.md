| --- |
| This feature is in preview release and subject to change\.  | 

To allow users to create, define, and access evaluation forms, assign the following **Analytics and optimization** security profile permissions: 
+ **Evaluation forms \- perform evaluations**: Allows a user, such as a Quality Assurance team member, to use an evaluation form to review a contact\. For an example image, see [Evaluate performance \(Preview\)](evaluations.md)\.
+ **Evaluation forms \- manage form definitions**: Allows admins and managers to [create](create-evaluation-forms.md) and [manage](evaluationform-audit-trail.md) evaluation forms\.

The **Admin** security profile has these permissions by default\. 

For information about how add more permissions to an existing security profile, see [Update security profiles](update-security-profiles.md)\.
