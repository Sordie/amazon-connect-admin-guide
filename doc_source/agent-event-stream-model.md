# Agent event streams data model<a name="agent-event-stream-model"></a>

Agent event streams are created in JavaScript Object Notation \(JSON\) format\. For each event type, a JSON blob is sent to the Kinesis data stream\. The following event types are included in agent event streams:
+ LOGIN—An agent login to the contact center\.
+ LOGOUT—An agent logout from the contact center\.
+ STATE\_CHANGE—One of the following changed:
  + The agent changed their status in the Contact Control Panel \(CCP\)\. For example, they changed it from Available to on Break\.
  + The state of the conversation between the agent and contact changed\. For example, they were connected and then on hold\. 
  + One of the following settings changed in the agent's configuration:
    + Their routing profile
    + The queues in their routing profile
    + Auto\-accept call
    + Sip address
    + Agent hierarchy group
    + Language preference setting in the CCP
+ HEART\_BEAT—This event is published every 120 seconds if there are no other events published during that interval\.
**Note**  
These events continue to be published up to an hour after an agent has logged off\.

+ Name—This is the [status of the agent that they manually set in the CCP](metrics-agent-status.md), or that the supervisor manually [changes in the real\-time metrics report](rtm-change-agent-activity-state.md)\. 

  For example, their status might be **Available**, which means that they are ready for inbound contacts to be routed to them\. Or it might be a custom status, such as Break or Training, which means that inbound contacts can't be routed to them BUT they can still make outbound calls\.
+ StartTimestamp—The timestamp in ISO 8601 standard format for the time at which the agent entered the status\.

+ FirstName—The agent's first name\.
+ HierarchyGroups—The hierarchy group the agent is assigned to, if any\.
+ LastName—The agent's last name\.
+ RoutingProfile—The routing profile the agent is assigned to\.
+ Username—the agent's Amazon Connect user name\.
Type: `Configuration` object

**Contacts**  
The contacts  
Type: `List of Contact Objects` object

## Configuration<a name="Configuration"></a>

The `Configuration` object includes the following properties:

**FirstName**  
The first name entered in the agent's Amazon Connect account\.  
Type: String  
Length: 1\-100

**AgentHierarchyGroups**  
The hierarchy group, up to five levels of grouping, for the agent associated with the event\.  
Type: `AgentHierarchyGroups` object

**LastName**  
The last name entered in the agent's Amazon Connect account\.  
Type: String  
Length: 1\-100

Type: `RoutingProfile` object\.

**Username**  
The user name for the agent's Amazon Connect user account\.  
Type: String  
Length: 1\-100

## Contact object<a name="Contact"></a>

The `Contact` object includes the following properties:

**ContactId**  
The identifier for the contact\.  
Type: String  
Length: 1\-256

**InitialContactId**  
The original identifier of the contact that was transferred\.  
Type: String  
Length: 1\-256

**Channel**  
The method of communication\.  
Valid values: `VOICE`, `CHAT`, `TASKS`

**InitiationMethod**  
Indicates how the contact was initiated\.   
Valid values:  
+  `INBOUND`: The customer initiated voice \(phone\) contact with your contact center\. 
+  `OUTBOUND`: An agent initiated voice \(phone\) contact with the customer, by using the CCP to call their number\. This initiation method calls the [StartOutboundVoiceContact](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_StartOutboundVoiceContact.html) API\.
+  `TRANSFER`: The customer was transferred by an agent to another agent or to a queue, using quick connects in the CCP\. This results in a new contact record being created\.
+  `CALLBACK`: The customer was contacted as part of a callback flow\. 

  For more information about the InitiationMethod in this scenario, see [About queued callbacks in metrics](about-queued-callbacks.md)\. 
+  `API`: The contact was initiated with Amazon Connect by API\. This could be an outbound contact you created and queued to an agent, using the [StartOutboundVoiceContact](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_StartOutboundVoiceContact.html) API, or it could be a live chat that was initiated by the customer with your contact center, where you called the [StartChatConnect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_StartChatContact.html) API\.
+  `QUEUE_TRANSFER`: While the customer was in one queue \(listening to Customer queue flow\), they were transferred into another queue using a flow block\.
+  `MONITOR`: A supervisor initiated monitor on an agent\. The supervisor can silently monitor the agent and customer, or barge the conversation\.
+  `DISCONNECT`: When a [Set disconnect flow](set-disconnect-flow.md) block is triggered, it specifies which flow to run after a disconnect event during a contact\. 

  A disconnect event is when:
  + A call, chat, or task is disconnected\.
  + A call is disconnected by a customer, agent, third party, supervisor, flow, telecom problem, API, or any other reason\.
  + A task is disconnected as a result of a flow action\.
  + A task expires\. The task is automatically disconnected if it is not completed in 7 days\. 

  If a new contact is created while running a disconnect flow, then the initiation method for that new contact is DISCONNECT\.

**State**  
The state of the contact\.  
Valid values: `INCOMING` \| `PENDING` \| `CONNECTING` \| `CONNECTED` \| `CONNECTED_ONHOLD` \| `MISSED` \| `REJECTED` \| `ERROR` \| `ENDED`   
The `REJECTED` state does not apply to voice contacts\. Rejected voice contacts appear as `MISSED`\.

Type: String \(*yyyy*\-*mm*\-*dd*T*hh*:*mm*:*ss*\.*sss*Z\)

Type: String \(*yyyy*\-*mm*\-*dd*T*hh*:*mm*:*ss*\.*sss*Z\)
