| This is prerelease documentation for a service in preview release\. It is subject to change\. | 

A simple use case of step\-by\-step guides is to have an agent enter a disposition code at the end of the contact\. To give your agents the ability to set disposition codes at the end of a contact or complete other post\-call work, you can create a flow that has one Show View block and one Set Attributes block\. You can use the Show View block to create a **Form** view that gives the agents the required input field, and then you can use the **Set contact attributes** block to save the response as contact attributes\. In addition, you can also use a Lambda flow block to send the entered data to an external system\.

After youâ€™ve created your flow, you will be able to dynamically determine which one to surface at the end of a contact by setting the **DisconnectFlowForAgentUI** as a custom attribute in your contact flows\. As long as this attribute is set before a contact ends, the agent UI will surface this form once a contact ends\.
