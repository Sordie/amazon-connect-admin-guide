It has two properties: 
+ **Timeout**: Run this branch if the customer hasn't sent a message after a specified amount of time\. Maximum is 7 days\.
  + Manually set timeout: You can provide the **Number** and **Units**\.
  + Dynamically set timeout: The unit of measurement is in seconds\.
+ **Customer return**: Run this branch when the customer returns and sends a message\. With this branch you can route the customer to the previous \(same\) agent, previous \(same\) queue, or override and set a new working queue or agent\. 

## Configuration tips<a name="wait-tips"></a>

You can add multiple **Wait** blocks to your contact flows\. For example: 
+ If the customer comes back in 5 minutes, connect them to the same agent\. This is because that agent has all of the context\.
+ If the customer doesn't come back after 5 minutes, send a text saying "We missed you\." 
+ If the customer comes back in 12 hours, connect to a flow that puts them in a priority queue\. However, it doesn't route them to the same agent\.
