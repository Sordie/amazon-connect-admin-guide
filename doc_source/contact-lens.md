# Contact Lens for Amazon Connect<a name="contact-lens"></a>

Contact Lens for Amazon Connect provides a set of conversational analytics and quality management capabilities, powered by machine learning\. For example, you can use these analytics to:
+ [Automatically categorize contacts based on uttered keywords and phrases](rules.md)\. This helps you understand the compliance of customer conversations\.
+ [Investigate customer sentiment](sentiment-scores.md)\.
+ [Search call and chat transcripts](search-conversations.md)\.
+ [Monitor agent performance in real\-time](add-rules-for-alerts.md)\.
+ [View contact summarization](contact-lens-call-summarization.md)\. 

Contact Lens helps you protect your customer's privacy by enabling you to [automatically redact sensitive data](sensitive-data-redaction.md) from conversation transcripts and audio files\.

You can define and assess agent performance criteria \(for example, adherence to required scripts\) and automatically pre\-populate evaluation forms\. This reduces the need for managers to do manual reviews, while more easily identifying coaching needs for your agents\.
