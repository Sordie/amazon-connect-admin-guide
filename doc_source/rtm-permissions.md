# Permissions required to view real\-time metrics reports<a name="rtm-permissions"></a>

To view real\-time metrics reports, you need to be assigned to a security profile that either has Access checked for **Access metrics** or **Real\-time metrics**\. When **Access metrics** is selected, the **Real\-time metrics, Historical metrics**, and **Agent activity audit** are automatically checked\. If you have **Access metrics** checked, you have access to all real\-time and historical reports\.
