| This feature is in preview release and subject to change\.  | 

A *reference ID* is a token that appears in the JSON output file\. It represents a specific question\. When building reports, you can use it in place of the exact wording of a question\. 

For example, a question might be "Did agents stick to the script?" but the next day the question might be changed to "Was there good script adherence?" Regardless of how the question is worded, the reference ID always stays the same\.
