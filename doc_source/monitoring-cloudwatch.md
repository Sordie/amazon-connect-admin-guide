# Monitoring your instance using CloudWatch<a name="monitoring-cloudwatch"></a>

Amazon Connect sends data about your instance to CloudWatch metrics so that you can collect, view, and analyze CloudWatch metrics for your Amazon Connect virtual contact center\. You can use this data to monitor key operational metrics and set up alarms\. Data about your contact center is sent to CloudWatch every 1 minute\.

When you view the CloudWatch metrics dashboard, you can specify the refresh interval for the data displayed\. The values displayed in the dashboard reflect the values for the refresh interval you define\. For example, if you set the refresh interval to 1 minute, the values displayed are for a minute period\. You can select a refresh interval of 10 seconds, but Amazon Connect does not send data more often than every 1 minute\. Metrics that are sent to CloudWatch are available for two weeks, and then discarded\. To learn more about metrics in CloudWatch, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/)\.

**Note**  
If your Amazon Connect instance was created on or before October 2018, you need to provide Amazon Connect with permission to begin publishing chat metrics to your CloudWatch account\. To do so, create an IAM policy with the following permission and attach it to the Amazon Connect service role\. You can find the Amazon Connect service role on the **Account overview** page for your Amazon Connect instance\.  

```
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "cloudwatch:PutMetricData",
  "Resource": "*",
  "Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
      "cloudwatch:namespace": "AWS/Connect"
    }

## Use CloudWatch metrics to calculate concurrent call quota<a name="connect-cloudwatch-concurrent-call-quota"></a>

**Important**  
The **ConcurrentCallsPercentage** calculation information is not the same as **ConcurrentTasksPercentage** and **ConcurrentChatPercentage**\.  
The metrics emitted for **ConcurrentCallsPercentage** are in decimal and not multiplied by 100\. The metric represents a percentage of your total quota\.
For **ConcurrentTasksPercentage** and **ConcurrentChatPercentage** the value is multiplied by 100\. That gives you your total quota\.
The metrics emitted are correct and there is no discrepancy in data\. 

Here's how to calculate your quota usage for concurrent calls\. 

With calls active in the system, look at **ConcurrentCalls** and **ConcurrentCallsPercentage**\. Calculate how much of your quota has been used: 
+ \(ConcurrentCalls / ConcurrentCallsPercentage\)

For example, if **ConcurrentCalls** is 20 and **ConcurrentCallsPercentage** is 50, your quota usage is calculated as \(20/50\) = 0\.40, which is **40% of your total quota**\.

## Use CloudWatch metrics to calculate concurrent active chats quota<a name="connect-cloudwatch-concurrent-chat-quota"></a>

Here's how to calculate your quota for concurrent active chats\. 

With chats active in the system, look at **ConcurrentActiveChats** and **ConcurrentChatsPercentage**\. Calculate the quota: 
+ \(ConcurrentActiveChats / ConcurrentActiveChatsPercentage\) \* 100

For example, if **ConcurrentActiveChats** is 1000 and **ConcurrentActiveChatsPercentage** is 50, your quota is calculated as \(1000/50\)\*100 = 2000\. Your total quota is 2000 chats\. 

## Use CloudWatch metrics to calculate concurrent task quota<a name="connect-cloudwatch-concurrent-task-quota"></a>

Here's how to calculate your quota for concurrent tasks\. 

With tasks active in the system, look at **ConcurrentTasks** and **ConcurrentTasksPercentage**\. Calculate the quota: 
+ \(ConcurrentTasks / ConcurrentTasksPercentage\)\*100

For example, if **ConcurrentTasks** is 20 and **ConcurrentTasksPercentage** is 50, your total quota is calculated as \(20/50\)\*100= 40\. Your total quota is 40 tasks\.
